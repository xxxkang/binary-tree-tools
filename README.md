# Binary Tree Visualization

An interactive tool to view an array as a binary tree, arrange it into a heap, or create a binary search tree.

## Fun Story

I was having a discussion with my friends after a weekly contest on LeetCode and had an argument on the validity of a test case for [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/insufficient-nodes-in-root-to-leaf-paths/ "1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths").
