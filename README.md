An interactive tool to visually display a binary tree represented by a serialized array.

## Usage

The tool converts a input string representing a binary tree in to a visual representation of the tree. The serialization `[1,2,3,4,null,6,7]` would look like the following:

```python
     1
    / \
   2   3
  /   / \
 4   6   7
```

Note that the non-numeric element will be interpreted as a missing child node.
